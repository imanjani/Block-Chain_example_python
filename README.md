# Simple Blockchain Python 

<img src="block_chain.jpg">


Understanding Blockchain isn't easy. At least it wasn't for me. I had to go through number of frustrations due to too few funcional examples of how this technology works. 

Remember that a Blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.


The github repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain and its client using Python. This blockchain has the following features:

- Possibility of adding multiple nodes to the blockchain
- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Simple conflict resolution between nodes
- Transactions with SHA256 encryption

The blockchain client has the following features:

- Wallets generation using Public/Private key encryption (based on SHA256 algorithm)
- Generation of transactions with SHA256 encryption 


*You will also need an HTTP client like Postman or curl. But anything will do.*
